Virtual Machine in C++

This project implements a simple Virtual Machine (VM) in C++ that supports basic arithmetic, bitwise operations, comparisons, and control flow instructions. It also demonstrates how to containerize the application with Docker and integrate Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

Features:

* Instruction Set:
	Arithmetic: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV
	Bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR
	Comparisons: CMP (with Zero flag)
	Control flow: JMP, JZ, JNZ
	I/O: PRN
	Miscellaneous: HLT (Halt)

* Containerization: The application is containerized using Docker for portability and ease of deployment.

* CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions is used to build and test the project.
